# Gcc AND CMake Tasks
<p>Compile with GCC a C++ program that uses a static and a dynamic library and optimize it using optimization flags.

mymath Library:
The following code defines a library called mymath, which includes two simple math functions: add and subtract. The main program uses these functions to add and subtract two numbers. The library should be created as a static and dynamic library using GCC.
Your program should use the library 1 million times to add and subtract different numbers
Your program should be linked with the static library and the dynamic library separately using GCC.
You should be able to explain the differences between static and dynamic libraries, and how to use them in a C++ program.
</p>
<h1>Gcc Task1:</h1>
<p>Write a C++ program that uses the given code as a dynamic library
Compile and link the program using GCC.
Test the program to make sure it works as expected.
</p>

<h1>Gcc Task2:</h1>
<p>
Write a C++ program that uses the given code as a static library
Compile and link the program using GCC.
Test the program to make sure it works as expected.

</p>

<h1>Gcc Task3:</h1>
<p>Use GCC optimization flags to improve the performance of the program.
Measure the performance of the program using a timing or profiling tool, and compare the execution time or performance metrics with the unoptimized version.
Use GCC to compile your program in debug and release mode and compare the performance difference in both modes.

</p>

<h1>Cmake Task1:</h1>
<p>Perform the above gcc task using CMake.
</p>

<h1>Cmake Task2:</h1>
<p>
Create a CMake project that uses a third-party library [Nlohmann/JSON] using CMake external project. The project should have a main executable that parses config.json file using a third-party library. You need to create a CMakeLists.txt file that sets up the build system for the project, including compiling and linking the executable with the third-party library. You should also be able to handle any dependencies between the third-party libraries.
